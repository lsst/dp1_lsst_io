Description
-----------

*Longer paragraph description.*

*Coadded images are created by combining overlapping visits.*

*Coadded images are made one per filter.*

*The tesselated coadded images are divided into tracts and patches. Quote sizes. Tract is about like the full focal plane and patch is about like a detector.*


Pixel data
^^^^^^^^^^

*Calibrated. Quote units, and how to convert to AB mags.*

Metadata
^^^^^^^^

*Metadata includes PSF, photcalib, WCS, etc.*
