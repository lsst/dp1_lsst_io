greater depth (to detect fainter objects).

Visit images
============

Processed and calibrated images from individual vists (single observations).

.. toctree::

Template images
===============

Coadded images generated specifically to be used as templates in difference image analysis.

    :titlesonly:
    :glob:

    template_image


Difference images
=================

Created by subtracting a template image from a visit image.
