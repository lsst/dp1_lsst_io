Survey property maps
####################

*High-level descriptions of what a survey propery map is.*

*For easy navigability try to structure each subsection the same (e.g., overview then pixel data then metadata, or whatever works). OK to make sub-sub-sections.*

*List the map types by name and describe what they show.*
