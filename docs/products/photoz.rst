Photo-z estimates
#################

As documented in the SIT-Com tech note "Initial studies of photometric redshifts with LSSTComCam from DP1"
(`SITCOMTN-154 <https://sitcomtn-154.lsst.io/>`_),
members of the Rubin Commissioning Science Unit for photometric redshifts have generated photo-z estimates for every galaxy in DP1.

Access to these photo-z estimates from the Rubin Science Platform is available via the :ref:`LSDB` and via the :ref:`PZ Server`.


PZ Server
=========

The `LSST PZ Server <https://docs.linea.org.br/en/sci-platforms/pz_server.html>`_ is an online service that is
complementary to the Rubin Science Platform (RSP).
The PZ Server hosts and produces pz-related lightweight data products and provides data management tools for data sharing and provenance.

The PZ Server provides an API interface that enables users to access photo-z and related data products
through Python scripts from any location.

See Appendix B.2 of `SITCOMTN-154 <https://sitcomtn-154.lsst.io/>`_ for more details on accessing the
photo-z datasets via the PZ Server.
