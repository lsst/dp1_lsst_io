======

Description
===========

HiPS maps (`Fernique et al. 2015 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...578A.114F/abstract>`_)
provide the means to pan and zoom a seamless, multiband tiling of the coadded images.

HiPS maps are "false color" maps that use three (or sometimes one or four) of the LSST's filters as inputs to the blue, green,
and red channels, with different scale settings adjusted to convey the filter information
in the coadded map.

Tutorials

See the :ref:`200-level portal <portal-200>`
