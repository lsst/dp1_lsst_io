Calibration stars
=================

Bright, isolated stars are detected in images and used for the photometric, astrometric, and PSF calibrations.

.. _calibration-photmetric:

Photometric
===========

Photometric calibrations correct the counts (electrons) measured by the camera to the incident flux from a source at Earth before it enters the atmosphere.

.. _calibration-astrometric:

Astrometric
===========

Astrometric calibrations define the World Coordinate System (WCS) of an image, the relation between pixel coordinate and sky coordinate (Right Ascension and Declination).
