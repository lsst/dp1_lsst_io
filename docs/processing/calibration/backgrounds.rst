Background subtraction
######################

Background subtraction removes the sky background (photons from the atmosphere) from the calibrated images.


Overview
========

A full-focal plane model of the camera's response to the night sky is generated from repeated exposures.
This model is then scaled to, and subtracted from, each per-detector image.
