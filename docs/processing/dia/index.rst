Difference image analysis
#########################

*High-level descriptions of how difference images are created and what measurements are made on them.*

*This is the DRP-DIA; there will be separate documentation prompt-processing.lsst.io.*

*Link to relevant technical documentation or publications.*

*A nice flow chart would be a good addition here (or link to it).*


.. _dia-image:

Difference images
=================

*Terms of 'diff' vs. 'direct'.*

*PSF-matching algorithm etc.*


.. _dia-source:

DIA source detection
====================

*Five-sigma detections in diffs. Measurements also in direct.*


.. _dia-object:

DIA source association
======================

*How DIA sources are associated by sky location into objects.*


.. _dia-forcephot:

DIA forced photometry
=====================

*How forced photometry is done in all direct and difference images at the location of all DIA objects.*
