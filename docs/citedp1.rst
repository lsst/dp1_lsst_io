`How to cite Rubin Observatory <https://rubinobservatory.org/for-scientists/documentation/cite>`_.

When citing this data release please reference the data release paper: |dp1_paper|.

For AAS publications please refer to the `facility <https://journals.aas.org/facility-keywords/>`_ as "Rubin:Simonyi" and for DP1 use "Rubin:Simonyi (LSSTComCam)".
The `Minor Planet Center <https://minorplanetcenter.net/iau/lists/ObsCodesF.html>`_ has allocated the telescope code X05.

The instrument itself can be formally cited as

|comcam_doi|

and that page includes additional references describing the camera.

When asked to cite the DP1 dataset as a whole please use:

|dataset_doi|

If you only use a specific subset, such as only querying the Objects catalog or only using the deep coadd images, you may cite the DOI explicitly assigned to that subset.
Each individual page in :ref:`products` includes the relevant DOI.
