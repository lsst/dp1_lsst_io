*Like the notebook template, italicized text should be removed or replaced.*


.. _api-101-1-intro:

Introduction
============

*Provide a light narrative about this tutorial, e.g., "This tutorial will demonstrate how to...".*

*Cite or link to any external information, documentation, or papers.*

*Describe key scientific concepts.*

**Related tutorials:**
*If applicable, mention other relevant tutorials by name but do not link to them.*
*Tutorials evolve continuously, there is no linkchecker for the notebook repo, and tutorial hotlinks will go stale quickly.*
*It is not necessary to mention the preceeding/subsequent tutorials in the same series as this one - those are trivial for the user to find.*
*But do use this section to mention related tutorials in other series.*
