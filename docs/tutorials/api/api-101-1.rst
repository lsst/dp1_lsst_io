101.1. How to get started with TOPCAT
#####################################

For the API Aspect of the Rubin Science Platform at data.lsst.cloud.

**Data Release:** DP1

**Last verified to run:** 2025-06-06

**Learning objective:** This tutorial provides a basic guide to set up `TOPCAT <http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/>`_ to explore the DP1 tables via the Rubin Science Platform (RSP) Table Access Protocol (TAP) service.

**LSST data products:** The DP1 catalogs within the RSP TAP service.

**Credit:** Based on tutorials developed by the Rubin Community Science team. Please consider acknowledging them if this tutorial is used for the preparation of journal articles, software releases, or other tutorials.

**Get Support:** Everyone is encouraged to ask questions or raise issues in the `Support Category <https://community.lsst.org/c/support/6>`_ of the Rubin Community Forum. Rubin staff will respond to all questions posted there.




**1. Create an RSP access token.**  
See the `Creating user tokens webpage <https://rsp.lsst.io/guides/auth/creating-user-tokens.html>`_
for a step-by-step guide for creating an RSP access token.  It is recommended that the token you create has the
following propoerties:  a name that includes "TOPCAT" as a substring, a scope of ``read:tap``,
and no expiration date.) The token will only be visible once.
*You must cut-and-paste the token to a secure file for future use.*
A new token is not needed for every TOPCAT session; the token can be reused, but it must be kept secure.

.. Important::
    **Note that tokens should be treated like passwords:  they should not be shared with others.
    Take precautions to keep tokens secure.  Never store tokens in git-tracked files.**
  
**2. Start up TOPCAT on your own computer.**
See `TOPCAT homepage <http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/>`_ for download and install instructions.

**3. Click on "Table Access Protocol (TAP) Query" under the “VO” menu.**
This will open up a separate Table Access Protocol (TAP) Query window.

    Figure 1:  The main TOPCAT window, with the "VO" menu pulled down and the "Table Access Protocol (TAP) Query" highlighted.

**4. Fill in the relevant in the “TAP URL” window and click the “Use Service” button in the Table Access Protocol (TAP) Query window.**
For DP1, use ``https://data.lsst.cloud/api/tap``.

    :alt: A screenshot of the the Table Access Protocol (TAP) Query window in which the value
          for the TAP URL has been filled in with the URL
	  https://data.lsst.cloud/api/tap .  A blue oval indicates the location of the
          Selected TAP Service panel in the window.

**5. Populate the Authentication window that pops up.**
Fill in ``x-oauth-basic`` for the "User" and your security token forthe "Password" and click "OK".

    :alt: A screenshot of the Authentication window. The user has been filled in with a value of x-oauth-basic,
	  and the password is shown (for security purposes) as a series of filled black circles.

    Figure 3:  The Authentication window with the values for the user and the password filled in.

**6. Note that the RSP TAP service is now accessible from your instance of TOPCAT.**
An indicator that the service is now accessible is that a list of DP1 tables available has appeared in the Metadata panel of the TAP Query window.

.. figure:: images/api-101-1-4.png
    :name: api-101-1-4
    :alt: A screenshot of the Table Access Protocol (TAP) Query window.
          The Table Access Protocol (TAP) Query window shows three panels, stacked vertically.  The
	  top panel is the Metadata panel, and it shows a list of DP1 schemas and tables that
	  are available to query.  The middle panel is the Service Capabilities panel, and it shows that
	  the available Query Language is ADQL-2.0.  The bottom panel is the ADQL Text panel, and it
	  indicates the current Mode is Synchronous; the bottom panels text box is currently empty.

    Figure 4:  The Table Access Protocol (TAP) Query window; a list of DP1 tables
    available for query can be be seen in the Metadata panel.

**7. In the left MetaData panel of the Table Access Protocol (TAP) Query window, click on the dp1.CcdVisit table.**
Note that the column names, data types, units, and descriptions for the columns of the dp1.CcdVisit table are shown in the right-hand panel.

.. figure:: images/api-101-1-5.png
    :name: api-101-1-5
    :alt: A screenshot of Table Access Protocol (TAP) Query window.
	  It appears the same as in Figure 4, but the dp1.CcdVisit table is highlighted
	  in the left-hand MetaData panel and the column names, data types, units, and
	  descriptions for the columns in the dp1.CcdVisit table are shown in the
	  right-hand MetaData panel.

    Figure 5:  The Table Access Protocol (TAP) Query window as in Figure 4, but here
    the dp1.CcdVisit table is highlighted in the left-hand MetaData panel and the
    column names, data types, units, and descriptions for the columns in the dp1.CcdVisit
    table are shown in the right-hand MetaData panel.

**8. At the bottom-left of the ADQL Text panel of the Table Access Protocol (TAP) Query window, click on the Examples button and choose the Full Table option under the Basic menu optoin.**

    :alt: A screenshot of of Table Access Protocol (TAP) Query window.
	  It appears the same as in Figure 5, but the Example button has been clicked
	  and the Full Table menu item from the Basic menu item has been chosen and
	  highlighted.

    the Full Table menu item from the Basic menu item chosen after clicking on
    the Examples button at the bottom of the ADQL Text panel.
    

**9. Note that the chosen ADQL example query now appears in the ADQL Text box of the Table Access Protocol (TAP) Query window.  Click on the Run Query button at the bottom of this window.**

	  It appears the same as in Figure 5, but the chosen ADQL example
	  query now appears in the ADQL Text box.

    the chosen ADQL example query now appears in the ADQL Text box.

**10. Note that a new table, TAP_1_dp1.CcdVisit, has appeared in the Table List panel of the main TOPCAT window.**

.. figure:: images/api-101-1-8.png
    :name: api-101-1-8
    :alt: A screenshot of the main TOPCAT window.  It is composed of four main parts.
	  1. A row of icons along the top of the window.  2. A Table List panel on the left
	  of the window; this currently shows one table, called TAP_1_dp1.CcdVisit,
	  and it is highlighted.  3. A Current Table Properties panel on the right of the window.
	  4. A small SAMP panel just below the Current Table Properties panel.

**11. Find the table of results in the "Table List" panel of the main TOPCAT window, and then click on the "Display table cell data" icon.**
It is the 4th icon from the left in the row of icons at the top of the main TOPCAT window (it looks like a table with the first row and first column grayed out).

**13. Explore.**
At this stage, the Rubin DP1 data set can be further explored via TOPCAT.  For an example, see
:doc:`api-101-2`.
