# Static content

This directory contains static content that is copied to the `_static/` directory in the HTML output.
This directory is useful for providing additional downloads with the HTML output.
Our current convention is to not use the `_static` directory for content images â€” instead, place the images alongside their page file or in an images/ subdirectory relative to that page.
